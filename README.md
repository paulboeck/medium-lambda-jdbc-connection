# simple-java-lambda

This project is meant to be an example of how to create and deploy an AWS Lambda function 
written in Java. The Lambda function simply returns the string "Hello World!".
There is no trigger defined for the lambda so it can only be invoked by using the Test feature in
the AWS Lambda console or via the SAM CLI.
